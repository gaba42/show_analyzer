He climbed onto the Mountainside Imagesâ€¦\\n And he vandalized and graffitied all over them!\\n Wait!\\n Ha haâ€¦\\n Why should I?\\n Hey, Naruto!\\n How did you suddenly get here, lruka Sensei?\\n The question is what are you doing here when you should be in class now?\\n Now listen, Naruto.\\n You failed the last graduation test and the one before that.\\n This is no time to be goofing off, you fool!\\n We will have a re-test on the Transformation Jutsu!\\n Even those who already passed will take it!\\n Whaaaat?!\\n Sakura Haruno. Here I goâ€¦\\n Transform!\\n OK!\\n I did it!\\n Cha!\\n Did you see that, Sasuke?\\n Next, Sasuke Uchiha.\\n Yes.\\n O-OK.\\n Next, Naruto Uzumaki.\\n This is a real pain.\\n And it\\'s all your fault.\\n Like I care!!\\n OKâ€¦\\n Good luck, Narutoâ€¦\\n Transform!\\n How was it?\\n I call it the \"Sexy Jutsu\"!\\n You fool! Stop making idiotic spells!\\n Darnâ€¦\\n Darnâ€¦\\n I won\\'t let you go home unless you clean that all up.\\n I don\\'t careâ€¦\\n There\\'s nobody home anyway.\\n Naruto...\\n What is it this time?\\n What I meant wasâ€¦\\n If you clean up all that mess, I\\'ll buy you ramen tonight.\\n Huh?!\\n Yes! I-I will finish it no time!\\n Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!\\n Naruto.\\n Why did you vandalize those faces?\\n Don\\'t you know who the Hokage leaders are?\\n Of course, I do!\\n I know they earned the title Lord Hokage\\n because they were the best Ninja of their time, right?\\n Especially the Fourth Hokage was a hero\\n who saved the village from the nine-tail demon fox.\\n Then why did you do that?\\n Because I\\'ll become a Hokage myself.\\n And I\\'ll be the greatest Hokage of all time!\\n So that everyone will finally learn to accept me!\\n By the way, Sensei, I have a favor to ask.\\n You want another bowl?\\n Mmmmâ€¦Noâ€¦\\n Can I borrow that Leaf headband for a while?\\n This?\\n No no!\\n This is worn only by those who have graduated from Ninja Academy.\\n Tomorrow, you willâ€¦\\n You\\'re so mean!\\n So that\\'s why you took off your gogglesâ€¦\\n Humph... One more bowl please!\\n We are now about to begin the graduation test.\\n When your name is called, proceed to the next classroom.\\n The test is on the Clone Jutsu.\\n Oh noâ€¦\\n Of all theâ€¦! That is my weakest Jutsu!\\n But stillâ€¦ I will do it no matter what!\\n Clone Jutsu!\\n Disqualified!\\n Iruka Sensei.\\n His physical coordination and stamina are excellent.\\n And he managed to come up with something.\\n Isn\\'t that enough for him to pass?\\n Mizuki Sensei... All the others created three or more clones.\\n Naruto created just one.\\n And it\\'s practically useless. I can\\'t give him a passing mark.\\n I \\'m a Ninja now!\\n You did well. That\\'s my son.\\n Congratulations for your graduation.\\n I\\'ll cook something good tonight!\\n Look at that one.\\n It\\'s that boy. I hear he\\'s the only one who failed.\\n Serves him right.\\n Imagine what would happen if he became a Ninja.\\n Isn\\'t that the boy who is actuallyâ€¦\\n Hey! We\\'re not supposed to talk about that.\\n Iruka. We need to talk later.\\n Yes, sir.\\n Iruka Sensei isn\\'t trying to be mean to you.\\n Then why only me?\\n He wants you to become strong from the bottom of his heart.\\n You both don\\'t have parents.\\n But I really wanted to graduate.\\n Heh... I guess I have no choiceâ€¦\\n I\\'ll let you in on a big secret.\\n Secret?\\n Iruka.\\n What is it, Lord Hokage?\\n I know how you feel. Butâ€¦\\n Naruto also grew up without knowing the love of his parentsâ€¦like you.\\n Let me go!\\n My mom and dad are still out there fighting!\\n Wake up, Iruka Sensei!\\n What\\'s the matter?\\n Come to Lord Hokage\\'s immediately!\\n I heard that Narutoâ€¦ stole the Scroll of Sealing.\\n The Scroll of Sealing?!\\n Let\\'s seeâ€¦\\n The first Jutsu isâ€¦ Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu?\\n What?! Already a Jutsu I\\'m no good at?\\n Lord Hokage! We can\\'t forgive him!\\n This is not just a prank!\\n The Scroll is a dangerous item that the First Hokage sealed!\\n Depending on its useâ€¦\\n It will be a major disaster if it is taken out of the village!\\n Yes. Bring Naruto here at once!\\n Yes, sir!\\n Where did you goâ€¦Naruto?\\n I will tell everyone in the village about this and eliminate Narutoâ€¦\\n Then the Scroll of Sealing will be mine!\\n Hey you, Naruto!\\n You found me..\\n And I\\'ve only learned one Jutsu.\\n He\\'s been practicing the Jutsuâ€¦\\n until he\\'s become this exhausted and dirtyâ€¦?\\n Listen, listen! I\\'m gonna show you this amazing Jutsu!\\n You\\'re gonna let me graduate if I can do it!\\n Isn\\'t it true that I can graduate if I can do one of the Jutsu written here?\\n Who told you that?\\n Mizuki Sensei. He told me about this scroll, and this placeâ€¦\\n Mizuki did?!\\n I\\'m impressed you found this place.\\n I see nowâ€¦how it is.\\n Naruto, give me that scroll.\\n Wait, waitâ€¦ What\\'s going on here?\\n Naruto! Never give him that scroll!\\n It is a dangerous object that contains forbidden Ninja Jutsu. It was sealed.\\n Mizuki used you in order to get it for himself!\\n W-Wha--?\\n Naruto, Iruka is only afraid of you holding that scroll!\\n Huh?\\n What are you saying, Mizuki! Don\\'t let him fool you, Naruto!\\n I will tell you the truth.\\n Idiot! Don\\'t do that!\\n After an incident 12 years ago, a rule was created.\\n A rule?\\n That is, Naruto, a rule everybody but you knows.\\n Except me?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n Stop it, Mizuki!\\n The rule forbids anyone from revealing that you are actually the Demon Fox Spirit!\\n Huh?\\n You are actually the Demon, Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit,\\n who killed Iruka\\'s parents and destroyed our village!\\n Stop it!\\n Everyone has been deceiving you ever since.\\n Didn\\'t you find it strange?\\n Why everyone hated you so much?\\n No! No! No! No! No!\\n Narutoâ€¦\\n Nobody accepts you. That\\'s why Iruka hates you so much!\\n Iruka... Naruto grew up without the love of parents.\\n Everyone avoids him like the plague after what happened.\\n That\\'s why he keeps misbehaving.\\n It\\'s the only way for him to get any attention or acknowledgement.\\n He pretends to be tough, but inside he is really hurting.\\n Die, Naruto!\\n Naruto! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGet down!\\n Whyâ€¦?\\n Because you and I are the same.\\n After my parents died,\\n nobody paid attention to me or gave me any support.\\n I wasn\\'t a good student in school.\\n I was the class clownâ€¦ because I wanted people to notice me.\\n I couldn\\'t get noticed through excellence, so I kept doing stupid things.\\n It was so hard.\\n Isn\\'t that right, Naruto?\\n You felt so lonelyâ€¦right? And you suffered inside, right?\\n I\\'m sorry, Narutoâ€¦.\\n If I had been more responsible, maybe you wouldn\\'t have suffered so much.\\n Don\\'t make me laugh!\\n Iruka has always hated you, ever since you killed his parents!\\n He\\'s just saying all that to get the Scroll of Sealing back!\\n Naruto!\\n Narutoooooo!\\n He is not the type of kid who will change his mind.\\n He will take revenge against our village using that scroll!\\n Didn\\'t you see his eyes? Those are the eyes of a Demon Fox.\\n Noâ€¦ Narutoâ€¦isn\\'tâ€¦like that at all!\\n All I want is to kill Naruto and get the scroll.\\n I\\'ll take care of you later!\\n I-I won\\'t let youâ€¦\\n Well, well.\\n Mizuki has a big mouth!\\n Naruto feels worse than he\\'s ever felt.\\n He might unleash the power locked up inside him.\\n The Scroll of Sealing is now with him.\\n There\\'s a slight chance he might actually release\\n the Nine-Tailed Fox Spirit sealed inside him!\\n If that happensâ€¦\\n I\\'ve found him!\\n Naruto!\\n Everything that Mizuki said was a lie!\\n Give me that scroll, quick! Mizuki is after the scroll!\\n It can\\'t beâ€¦\\n Why is it, Naruto?\\n Howâ€¦\\n did you know I wasn\\'t Irukaâ€¦?\\n Because I\\'m Iruka.\\n I see.\\n What\\'s in it for you to protect the one who killed your family?\\n I\\'m not gonna let a stupid idiot like you get that scroll!\\n You\\'re the idiot. Naruto is the same as me.\\n Same?\\n Anyone can do whatever he wants once he has the scroll.\\n There is no way that that monsterâ€¦\\n that Fox Spirit, won\\'t take advantage of the power of that scroll!\\n You\\'re rightâ€¦\\n I guess it was true all along!\\n See, Iruka Sensei never really cared for me at all!\\n ...if he was the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n But Naruto is different!\\n I know that he is an exceptional student.\\n He works very hard,\\n and he\\'s single-minded and clumsy at the same time.\\n No one accepts him, but he knows the meaning of human suffering.\\n He is not the Demon Fox Spirit.\\n He\\'s Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leaves!\\n You are so gullible. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlruka!\\n I was gonna take you down later, but I have changed my mind.\\n Die!\\n I guess this is the end for meâ€¦\\n Naruto?!\\n You surprised me there, freak.\\n If you ever lay a hand on Iruka Sensei, I\\'ll kill you!\\n Shut up! I can take care of a kid like you with a single blow!\\n Why don\\'t you try then? I\\'ll strike you back a thousand-fold!\\n Let\\'s see you try! Show me what you can do, Demon Fox!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu!\\n Naruto! You\\'veâ€¦\\n Those aren\\'t just images but actual clones! That\\'s an advanced Ninjutsu!\\n What\\'s thisâ€¦?\\n What\\'s the matter? \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC\\'mon!\\n Weren\\'t you gonna get me with one blow? Here!\\n In that caseâ€¦ I\\'ll come to you.\\n I kinda got carried away. lruka Sensei, are you okay?\\n Yeah.\\n He\\'s really something.\\n Maybe it is true.\\n Maybe he will surpass all the Hokage leadersâ€¦\\n Naruto, come over here. I\\'d like to give you something.\\n Has anyone found Naruto yet?\\n No.\\n Darn, this is going to be badâ€¦\\n There\\'s no need to worry anymore.\\n Lord Hokage!\\n He\\'ll be back soon.\\n Sensei, how much longer?\\n OK, you may open your eyes now.\\n Congratulationsâ€¦on your graduation.\\n In celebration, we\\'ll have ramen tonight!\\n Iruka Sensei!\\n That hurts!\\n Narutoâ€¦\\n I was going to lecture to you...\\n that the road gets more difficult now that you\\'re a Ninja.\\n But I guess I\\'ll just wait to tell you that until we get to the ramen standâ€¦\\n W-What do you want, you little shrimp? Quit following me!\\n You\\'re smaller than me and\\n you\\'re saying that you\\'re gonna become the Fifth Hokage?\\n I don\\'t care if you are the 3rd Hokage\\'s grandson or not.\\n It\\'s not that easy to be a Hokage!\\n If you want it that bad, you\\'re gonna have to beat me first!\\n Next episode:  \"My Name Is Konohamaru!\"\\n Watch my outstanding performance!\\n'"
