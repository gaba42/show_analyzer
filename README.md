## Features

- **Subtitle Parsing**: Convert raw subtitle files (e.g., `.srt`) into a clean text dataset for further processing.  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenize text, remove stop words, and optionally apply lemmatization or stemming.  
- **Character-Level Analysis**: Break down which characters speak the most, identify unique word usage per character, etc.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine overall sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) for each line, episode, or season.  
- **Word Frequency & Word Clouds**: Easily generate frequency distributions and word clouds to see the most frequent terms.  
- **Topic Modeling (optional)**: Use algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover hidden themes in dialogue.
